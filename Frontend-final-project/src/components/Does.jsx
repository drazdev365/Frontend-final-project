          How Does Leasing Work?
        </h1>
        <p className="w-[380px] h-[126px] text-[16px]">
          Leasing a vehicle is essentially entering into a long term rental
          agreement for that vehicle. Unlike a traditional car purchase, you
          donâ€™t actually own the vehicle. Instead, a leasing company purchases
          the vehicle from the dealer on your behalf and then you make monthly
          payments to the leasing company for the duration of your lease. Some
          leases however, do provide the option to purchase the vehicle at the
          end of the lease.
